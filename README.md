# WE SHARE 

![Alt text](/App/assets/images/logo.png)


Welcome to WeShare, the new way to quickly share contacts!!!

The project started as a university project for the Human Computer Interaction On The Web course, it is proposed to exchange contacts between two or more users through the NFC technology.

In this version, the base of the application is proposed, with the following features:

    1. create, edit and delete a card 
    2. possibility to exchange links of Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter 
    3. save a card on the contact page
    4. search for a contact on the page and view all the information that a contact has exchanged with us

What is currently not working:

    1. sometimes the contact is not saved on the contact page
    2. the input is not responsive in the whole area, but only near the placeholder
    3. the stack is not reset when changing a page from the panel

Future implementations: 

    1. persistent database
    2. NFC technology (unfortunately, we could not implement it due to the library's icompatibility with Expo)
    3. feature that allows to share a contact with multiple users
    4. more options in the settings to customize the app

Unfortunately we don't know if we will be able to complete the app, as we have finished the exam, maybe one day in spare time we will finish the app.
