# DISCORSO - TASK

## slide 8

Now I'm talking about the task and features of the application. The app is has basically 3 functions. As we can see in this slide, after logging in the first panel is the profile one, where you can manage all user-created profiles, create new ones, edit or delete existing ones.

In this slide, however, we see the share panel, where we can share our profiles with other users: after selecting the profile we want to share, simply bring the phones together to allow nfc to exchange data.
If everything works we arrive at the last page of the share, where we will ask the user if they want to save the contact or discard it.

The last function is the page of contact, where we can find all the contacts who have shared their information with us. The list is sorted by the time the share was made, but you can search for a specific contact through the search bar. If you click on a card you can see all informations the contact shares with you.
